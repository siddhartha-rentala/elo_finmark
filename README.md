## Abstract

This project investigates how the traditional Elo rating system can be adapted to rank securities in financial markets. By redefining monthly return comparisons as "games" between securities and reinterpreting the Elo update mechanism within a logistic regression framework, this work aims to provide a dynamic, risk-adjusted methodology for asset ranking and portfolio construction.

## Assumptions

- **Pairwise Comparison:**  
  Each security competes in a "game" defined by comparing its monthly average return with that of another security, meaning every security is pitted against all others every month.

- **Win Definition:**  
  A security wins a game if its monthly average return exceeds that of its opponent.

- **Continuous vs. Binary Outcomes:**  
  Unlike traditional sports results (win/loss), financial returns are continuous. This necessitates extending the binary Elo framework to account for the magnitude of return differences.

- **Market Dynamics:**  
  The system must capture market volatility, risk, and the evolving nature of financial performance. Extensions are needed to incorporate additional factors over time.
## Future Work

This project lays the groundwork for adapting the Elo rating system to rank securities based on monthly returns. While the basic model offers a promising starting point, further work is needed to:
- Empirically validate the proposed extensions.
- Fine-tune model parameters.
- Incorporate additional risk factors and dynamic adjustments.

Feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome as I continue to refine this model.
